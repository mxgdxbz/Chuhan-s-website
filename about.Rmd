### Professional Experience  
**Hospital for Special Surgery, Data Research Intern**     
 ▪ Communicated with lead surgeons and cooperatively identified promising variables with impact on hospital-acquired infection (HAI) rate both in operative procedure and post-operative care of spinal surgeries      
 ▪ Quantified team consistency score for each spinal surgery based on survey data collected from surgeons, anesthetists as well as assistants and transferred into a continuous variable in building HAI prediction models   
 ▪ Implemented regression modeling on 20+ variables and performed nested cross-validation in support of model selection   
 ▪ Highly appraised for proposing and successfully performing ROC analysis to further determine the appropriate cut-off values for team consistency score  
 ▪ Generated visualizations including correlograms, tables as well as graphs and reported results to data manager periodically    

**Boehringer-Ingelheim CO., Quality Assurance Intern**     
 ▪ Monitored medicines quality through gathering and analyzing related quality reports to detect potential quality issues     
 ▪ Implemented corrective or preventive actions(CAPA) to assure medicine safe supply in a timely and effective way   
 ▪ Connected with downstream suppliers and reviewed qualification documents to ensure their adherence to GMP standard    
 ▪ Worked as the head intern to lead intern training session and inspire team spirit

**Jiaofu Biomed, Data Research Intern**    
▪ Examined rationality of experimental designs and extracted valid research data from over 100 glioma studies  
▪ Created data records for small-molecule chemo drugs without error to capture their properties and efficacy in glioma cells   
▪ Processed data into desirable format and performed exploratory analysis to handle missing values and outliers  
▪ Utilized statistical test in SPSS to validate efficacy and safety properties of target molecules in preclinical studies   
▪ Improved reports summarizing methods and results for client delivery and was honored with an Innovation Award


### Research Experience  
**Racial Survival Disparities in patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer, [Mediation Analysis Project](Report_cz2493.pdf)**     
▪ Cooperatively develop a project to investigate determinants of racial survival disparities in patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer      
▪ Effectively researched on survey data as well as medical records and extracted 1500+ eligible records for further analysis  
▪	Employed both parametric methods (Accelerated Failure Time) and Semi-parametric methods (Proportional Hazards Model) to separately quantify the mediation effect of diagnosis stage and surgery waiting time on racial survival disparities  
▪	Professionally developed the framework to conduct mediation analysis for censored data in the clinical practice  

**Smoking in the Framingham Heart Study, [Longitudinal Analysis Project](final_proj.html)**  
▪	Described the smoking habits(smoking status and number of cigarettes per day) of the participants in the Framingham Heart study as they age   
▪	Determined the impact of smoking on certain health outcomes,including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and serum total cholesterol.  

**Machine Learning Techniques in Transaction Data, [Data Mining Project](final_project_cz2493.pdf)**    
▪ Identified key determinants closely related to consumer purchase capability and predicted their total expenditure 
▪ Clustered consumers based on their shopping records so as to estimate their purchase pattern and help providers tailor advertizing in a way attractive to the target groups of consumers.  


**Crime Research in New York City, [Data Science Project](https://veronica574.github.io/final_project_crime/)**  
▪ Focusing on providing information about crimes in NYC. The map helps to visualize where crimes occured in nyc. The trend of crimes shows the change over years and months. 
▪ Addressed the lead causes to the regional difference in crime rate. We collected the data about income and unemployment rate and analyzed their association with crime rate. 
▪ Compared dinstinct words in offense type of felony and violation. Overall, our analysis include region, time, criminal types which associated with crimes in NYC.

### Core Competence  
▪ Strong programming and analytical skills  
▪ Professional experience with clinical research and statistical analysis  
▪ Working knowledge of clinical trial design and drug development process  
▪ Proficiency in R(dashboard, shiny), SAS (macro, proc sql), SQL(query, subquery) and MS Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access)    
▪ Familiarity with Python, SPSS and Mplus  
▪ Profound interest in improving patient outcomes and driving innovation in healthcare system
