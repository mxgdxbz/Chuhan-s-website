Hi,

I am a statiscal analyst at __Pacira Pharmaceuticals,Inc__. I joined Pacira right after I graduated from Columbia University in 2019 with a M.S. degree in  *_Biostatistics_*. I completed my undergraduate study at Fudan University and acquired my B.S. degree in _Pharmaceutical Science_. I have been passionate about data analytics in the healthcare industry, especially for its use in new drug development and clinical trial design to drive innovative solutions. That is why I made my decision to transfer to Biostatistics for graduate study. I have been growing statistical knowledge through the two-year course training and two-year work practices. Now I am the leading statistician for a phase IV study, mainly responsible for the **Trial Data Mornitoring** and **Statistical Analyses** work in our study team.

Warm Regards,



_Chuhan_
