<p style="text-align:justify;">   
I am a statiscal analyst at Pacira Pharmaceuticals,Inc. I joined Pacira right after I graduated from Columbia University in 2019 with a M.S. degree in  **Biostatistics**. I completed my undergraduate study at Fudan University and acquired my B.S. degree in **Pharmaceutical Science**. I have been passionate about data analytics in the healthcare industry, especially for its use in new drug development and clinical trial design to drive innovative solutions. That is why I made my decision to transfer to Biostatistics for graduate study. I have been growing statistical knowledge through the two-year course training and two-year work practices. Now I am the leading statistician for a phase IV study, mainly responsible for the **data mornitoring** and **statistical analysis** work in our study team.

<p style="text-align:justify;">  
Now, I have completed the required courses in my program and am looking for a **full-time analyst position** in Healthcare Company, Research Institute or Pharma. I am confident that my combined knowledge of biostatistics and professional experience will enable me to be qualified for this role.
